GULP - compile JADE templates


Based on the implementation of: Blaine Bublitz (gulp-jade) : https://github.com/phated/gulp-jade

As in gulp-jade, this Gulp plugin will compile jade templates. 
Difference: you can specify the file extension [ you are no longer limited for 2 extensions: html or js ]
This will come in handy if you use this plugin with AngularJS $templateCache
